      <h1>Heaven</h1>

      <p1>Heaven is a literal place, accessible through various pathways connected to Elia. It is a land both grounded in hard realities and subject to the whims of those who inhabit it, morphing and changing to suit its occupants. When the Gods walked there, each held sway over their own domain. The realm of Pygmalion was a single enormous library filled with countless volumes of esoteric wisdom; the realm of Laria was a cold, dark garden of the night. Each God bent the land to better please them.

      <br>
      These various realms were simultaneously connected and ever drifting apart. Even their placement in relation to each other was subject to change based upon the moods and subconscious desires of the Gods who ruled them. Thus, the realms of Pygmalion and his wife Sotiria were rarely far from each other; whereas the realms of Ambrus and Tydeus were often as far from each other as possible.

      The Demigods were free to pursue their own desires. Some rarely strayed from their Divine parent, while others spent their days on Elia. While the individual demeanors of the Demigods were as varied as the Demigods themselves, some generalizations can be made. They were selfish, arrogant, jealous, and manipulative. They were also capable of sympathy, pity, charity, and compassion. Though the former traits often overpowered the latter. The freedom they were given would sometimes lead to conflict, though the presence of the Gods would always prevent these conflicts from leading to outright war.

      Mortal supplicants were barred from entry to Heaven by Pygmalion, though he never deigned to explain why. All the same, the location of the paths to Heaven were eventually discovered by Mankind and those seeking the blessings of the Gods would make a pilgrimage to the closest pathway and make sacrifice to the God in question. Occasionally their pleas would be heard and answered, but no mortal has ever seen Heaven. This is for the best, as the Heaven of today is not fit for mortal eyes. The God Realms are crumbling and stand as a grim reminder of the grandeur that once was. There is little enough life now in Heaven. Most Demigods have left, and what few remain have long since lost their sanity.
