                <h3>Pygmalion, King of The Gods</h3>
                <p>Pygmalion, God of Knowledge, is the King of the Gods. Known to mortals as “The Keeper of Knowledge”. Those seeking his blessing must read something new every day, so that they may show their dedication to the pursuit of knowledge. Like all Gods, he burst into being at the birth of Creation. Aloof and capricious, Pygmalion was content to let the residents of Heaven and Elia go about their existence without much interference from him. He rarely left his Great Library and, when he did, was given to fits of rage until he was able to return to his Divine Scrolls. While open conflict between the Gods was almost unheard of, animosity towards Pygmalion was nonexistent. He was loved by most and respected by all.</p>

                <h3>Sotiria, Queen of the Gods</h3>
                <p>Sotiria, Goddess of Fertility, Queen of the Gods. Called “The Mother of All Things” by mortals. Those seeking her blessing must grow something in or at their home. She too was somewhat aloof, though she lacked her husband’s unpredictable nature. At times she would be forced to act as regent and mediator between the Gods. Her calm demeanor and the wisdom of her words was valued by all.</p>

                <h3>Cleon, God of War, Hykos</h3>
                <p>Cleon, God of War, Leader of the Hykos. Known as “the Lord of Battle” by mortals, gaining his favor requires fighting with a military company or war clan at least once. When Sotiria’s wisdom and counsel could not cool the tempers of Heaven, Cleon maintained the peace through terrifying power. At war and conflict, no God could hope to challenge Cleon. It is largely thanks to him that Heaven was not witness to any major war between the Gods.</p>

                <h3>Demophon, Goddess of Death, Hykos</h3>
                <p>Demophon, Goddess of Death. Known as “Death’s Companion’, those seeking his favor must pray in a place of death. Demophon was sullen, contemplative, and utterly without conscience. Obsessed with refining the nature of Death and what it meant to be Dead, Demophon was the least active of all the Gods. Indeed, there those who believe Demophon herself died long ago and became something…more. </p>

                <h3>Ambrus, God of Engineering, Hykos</h3>
                <p>Ambrus, God of Engineering. Ambrus was, perhaps, one of the most alien of the Gods. He believed Creation could be mapped into its constituent pieces and from this mapping an even greater power could be obtained. A master of systems and mechanisms, it was Ambrus who first crafted the Celestial Engines, thereby instilling a sense of order to the chaos of Creation. Utterly logical and distressingly pragmatic, Ambrus was difficult to interact with. This, combined with his distain for all things natural, lead to a great many rifts within Heaven itself.</p>

                <h3>Rotas, God of Time, Hykos</h3>
                <p>To describe the God of Time is to describe chaotic purpose. Its whims and machinations are utterly indecipherable to any who did not share its vision of Time. Rotas has no followers or supplicants. In fact, it is unknown the extent to which mortals were even aware of his presence.</p>

                <h3>Tydeus, God of the Sea, Hykos</h3>
                <p>Tydeus, God of the Sea. Called “Storm-Bringer” by mortals, his followers must kneel outside to offer a short prayer whenever it rains. His domain was that of change, steady and inexorable. At once brash and unwavering, he found the intellectual pursuits of his more cerebral brethren to be utterly without merit. Creation is ever changing, it was the duty of the Gods to ride upon the waves of that change and submit to its will.</p>
